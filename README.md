  Coding challenge with Django & DRF
  
  I tried to follow HackSoft Styleguide for Scalable DRF, 
  although this should be implemented with ModelViewSet and ModelSerializers.
  
  All the business logic is handled by [services](https://github.com/HackSoftware/Django-Styleguide#services) and [selectos](https://github.com/HackSoftware/Django-Styleguide#selectors).
  
  The testing was implemented with factory-boy and pytest.
  
  You can check the api docs in [postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/20286147/UVyq1d3m)
